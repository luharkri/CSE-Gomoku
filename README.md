# CSE-Gumoku
  Gomoku is an abstract strategy board game. It is traditionally played with pieces(black and white) on a board with 15x15 intersections. 
# How to Play
  The black plays first if white did not win in the previous game, and players alternate
  in placing a stone of their color on an empty intersection. The winner is the first player to get an
  unbroken row of five stones horizontally, vertically, or diagonally.
