# CSE-Gumoku
    Gomoku is an abstract strategy board game. It is traditionally played with pieces(black and white) on a board with 15x15 intersections.
    The black plays first if white did not win in the previous game, and players alternate
    in placing a stone of their color on an empty intersection. The winner is the first player to get an
    unbroken row of five stones horizontally, vertically, or diagonally. 
    
# CSE-Nine Mens Morris
    Nine Men’s Morris is a mill-forming	board game for two people that plays like a cross between Tic-Tac-Toe, Checkers, and Go.
    Each of	the	24 intersections on	the	grid is called a point.	The two	players	get	9 pieces each to place on these points.	The	goal
    of the game is to reduce your opponent to less than 3 pieces remaining by forming mills(three pieces in a row).
